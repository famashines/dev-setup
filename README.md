# Setting up Development Environment

## Slack: The Digital Office Space

Imagine you're in a large office building. This building has various rooms for different teams, private spaces for one-on-one discussions, and bulletin boards for important announcements. Now, imagine this entire setup in a digital format. That's what Slack is - a digital office space.

In Slack, the different rooms are called **channels**. You can have channels for different teams (like #python or #c++), for different projects (like #website-redesign), or for different purposes (like #announcements). Just like in a physical office, you can walk into a channel, catch up on the conversation, and start participating.

For private one-on-one or group discussions, Slack provides **Direct Messages (DMs)**. It's like having a private room where you can discuss things away from the crowd.

Slack also allows you to share files, react to messages with emojis, and even integrate with other tools to bring all your work into one place.

### Getting Started with Slack

To start using Slack, you'll first need to download the Slack app. You can download it for free for mobile devices and desktop. Once you've downloaded the app, you can sign up using your email address.

After signing up, you'll be part of a **workspace**. A workspace is like your own unique office building in Slack. You can join channels, send direct messages, and customize your profile within this workspace.

Remember, just like in a real office, it's important to maintain a professional and respectful communication style in Slack. Happy Slacking!

## Google Meet: The Virtual Meeting Room

Imagine you're in a conference room with colleagues or friends, discussing ideas, sharing updates, or just catching up. Now, imagine doing all of that from the comfort of your own home, or anywhere in the world, really. That's Google Meet - a virtual meeting room.

In Google Meet, you can start a meeting and invite others to join, or you can join a meeting started by someone else. It's like walking into a conference room, but instead of a physical room, you have a meeting link.

During a meeting, you can see and speak with others, share your screen, and even turn on live captions. It's like being in a real meeting, but with added features to enhance communication and collaboration.

### Getting Started with Google Meet

To start using Google Meet, you'll first need to sign in to your Google account and go to meet.google.com. You can start a meeting from here, or you can join a meeting using a link shared with you. All you need is a microphone and an optional webcam.

Google Meet is also integrated into other Google products like Gmail and Google Office, so you can start or join meetings directly from these platforms.

Remember, just like in a real meeting, it's important to maintain a professional and respectful communication style in Google Meet.

During a Google Meet meeting, you can easily turn your microphone and camera on and off. Here's how:

**Microphone**:
- To mute or unmute your microphone during a meeting, click on the microphone icon at the bottom of the screen.
- You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + D` (Windows) or `Command + D` (Mac) to mute or unmute your microphone.

**Camera**:
- To turn your camera on or off, click on the camera icon at the bottom of the screen.

Remember, it's important to check your video and audio settings before you join a meeting to ensure others can hear you and view your video better.

## Jira: The Project Management Tool

Imagine you're working on a large project with multiple tasks that need to be tracked, assigned, and completed. Now, imagine a tool that lets you do all of that in a systematic and organized manner. That's Jira - a project management tool.

In Jira, you can create a **project** and within that project, you can create **issues**. Issues are individual tasks that need to be done. They can be anything from fixing a bug, implementing a feature, or just itemizing out work for easy assignment.

There are different types of issues in Jira. The most basic is the regular "Issue", also called "Stories". You can create these from your default board. Issues can be linked to other issues in a few different ways. It's common for software problems to be very interconnected, so this feature is very useful.

You can also create "Child Issues" known as subtasks. These issues don't show up on your primary board, but are linked directly to the parent issue. In a way, they allow you to break down larger issues into individual pieces of work.

The final and most important type of issue are "Epics." Epics don't track individual bugs or features, but act as a large scale collection of issues that are all related to a particular area of work.

### Important Terms

1. **Epic**: Think of an epic as a book in a series. It's a large body of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller stories or tasks. An epic might represent a new feature, a customer request, or a business requirement.

2. **User Stories**: User stories are like chapters in that book. They describe one aspect of the epic in a way that is easy to understand for both the team and the customer. A user story might represent a functionality or feature from a user's perspective.

3. **Tasks**: Tasks are like scenes in a chapter. They are pieces of work that need to be done to complete the user story. A task might represent a work item that needs to be done.

4. **Sub-Tasks**: Sub-tasks are like actions in a scene. They are smaller pieces of work that need to be done to complete a task. A sub-task might represent a single unit of work.

### Workflow Stages:

1. **To Do**: This is like the pile of books you plan to read. These are tasks that are in the queue to be worked on.

2. **In Progress**: This is the book you're currently reading. These are tasks that are currently being worked on.

3. **In Review**: This is like discussing the book in a book club. These are tasks that have been completed and are awaiting review.

4. **Done**: This is like the book you've finished reading and put on your shelf. These are tasks that have been completed and approved.

### Getting Started with Jira

To start using Jira, you'll first need to sign up for Jira Software. Once you've signed up, you can log into your Jira Software site.

## Git: The Time Machine for Your Code

Imagine you're writing a book and you want to be able to go back to any previous version of your book at any time. You also want to be able to try out different plot lines without messing up your main story. That's what Git is - a time machine for your code.

In Git, your codebase is like your book. Each version of your code is a **commit**, which is like a snapshot of your book at a certain point in time. You can go back to any commit at any time.

You can also create **branches** in Git, which are like different plot lines for your book. You can work on these branches without affecting your main plot line (the **main** branch), and you can merge them back into the main branch when you're ready.

Remember, just like writing a book, using Git requires practice and patience. Don't worry if it seems complicated at first - with time, it will become second nature.

## GitHub: The Library of Code

Imagine a vast library where each book is a project containing code. You can read any book, suggest edits, or even make your own copy to work on. That's GitHub - a library of code.

In GitHub, each project is a **repository** (or repo for short). It's like a book in the library. A repository contains all the files for a project, including the revision historyÂ¹.

You can **fork** a repository, which is like making your own copy of a book. This allows you to experiment and make changes without affecting the original project.

You can suggest changes to a project by making a **pull request**. It's like suggesting edits to a book. The project owner can review your changes and choose to merge them into the project.

## Visual Studio Code: The Multitool for Coding

Imagine you're a carpenter and you have a toolbox full of different tools. Now, imagine a single tool that combines all those tools into one. That's what Visual Studio Code is - a multitool for coding.

In VS Code, you can write code in multiple languages, debug your code, manage your source code with Git, and even customize your coding environment. It's like having a hammer, screwdriver, wrench, and more, all in one tool.

VS Code also supports extensions, which are like additional tools you can add to your multitool. These extensions can provide additional features like auto-completion, linting, themes, and more.

### Getting Started with Visual Studio Code

To start using VS Code, you'll first need to download and install it. You can download the latest version of VS Code from the official VS Code website. Once you've downloaded the installer, run it to install VS Code.

After installing VS Code, you can open it and start coding right away. You can open a file or folder by going to `File > Open File` or `File > Open Folder`. You can also customize your coding environment by going to `File > Preferences > Settings`.

Remember, just like using a multitool, using VS Code effectively requires practice and patience. Don't worry if it seems complicated at first - with time, it will become second nature.
